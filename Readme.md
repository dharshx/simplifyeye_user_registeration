# About_Me

Hi, I am Dharshini Vasudevan, a graduate student at University of Texas at Arlington . During the course of my undergraduate study, I have been exposed to subjects such as Data Mining, C++ programming, Python programming, Database Management System, Java, Data Structures, Software Engineering, Operating Systems, and Statistics. Engrossed by Python Programming,I advanced myself with a certification course and I was exhilarated to find its applications to the variety of real-world problems.

# Career_Motivation

I have had my career path take great diversions . Everyone wants to try out different career paths before they actually fixate on one. I myself am one such person. I have had dreams of becoming a doctor since a kid but as I grew , I became fond of computers and coding. Coding and programming is a like a deep sea which drags you right in . It is such a pleasure to see your design come out good after having to construct lines of codes for hours put together. The level of pride to see my first ever web page design online which would have probably taken turns and dead-ends so many times , was a phenomenal experience ! This completely excited me and that's why I realized this was my thing . I wanted to make a career in the technical field of the world .

At first I was not sure what direction I must pay attention to . Then I got in touch with my seniors who put me in limelight and guided me with how I can be successful in my future , making a career out of computer science. I decided to do my undergraduate degree in computer science . I have also gained professional experience in the technical field during my internships . I did my first internship virtually , where I worked as a full stack web developer . I got hands-on experience in HTML , CSS programming languages . I also worked with JavaScript and Flutter efficiently. I felt like fish out of water at the start of my internship as it was my first ever time working for someone . I needed the design of the web page to be in the best form . But it isn't always easy . It took me probably about 10,000 lines of edited , raw code to get the right one for the design . My boss was really impressed with the work I had done and he decided to extend my internship period and also gave me an opportunity to work with the back-end team too. I then worked with PHP/MySQL for the database connectivity. It was totally a splendid experience overall. At the end of my internship , my boss , who happened to be the CEO of the company , awarded me a letter of recommendation for the work well done!

# Projects 

My very recent projects include : Toxic Comments Classifier - We are building a model capable of detecting and classifying toxic comments using machine learning . UBIAI NLP Training Model -Trained a NLP model from scratch which is ready to be deployed for a workshop hosted by UBIAI during March 2022. Also , created a chatbot using GoogleDialogFlow , which will assist the customers of a Burger Shop to place their order.I have worked on few group projects for my college’s computer fair in which I teamed up with my classmates to create a horoscope based fortune teller, online. I recently did a guided project on Neural networking using TensorFlow. I also have done LIVE projects on Flutter and WordPress. Some of my other projects are listed on my website/portfolio. Fun fact - I designed and curated my own website/portfolio : https://isntshedharshii.wixsite.com/website .

# Achievements

On March 4th 2022 , I received and was recognized on stage for “ Dr.Judith J.Carrier Scholarship and award ” by Dr.Judith J. Carrier herself at the Greater Arlington Chamber's Women Luncheon held at Live! by Lowes Hotel. I was the only international graduate recipient of the scholarship award . I was also the only graduate student from my entire college to receive this award . It was the most proudest moment of my life . 

I was given an opportunity recently to attend & volunteer at the 6th Annual Business Symposium at the The University of Texas at Arlington -College of Business , hosted by my professor.
The topic was “ Explainable and Unbiased Artificial Intelligence “ .

I am also serving as the ‘Vice President’ of Association of Information Technology Professionals ( AITP ) , an organization at UTA. Prior to this , I served as the ' Treasurer ' of the same organization.

I have also presented three papers in my undergraduate college conferences, for which the paper titled ‘Deep Learning’ , won first place in an inter-collegiate event. I have enthusiastically taken part in many workshops and webinars conducted in and around my city by various colleges and universities. Workshops on Amazon Alexa, Machine Learning, Arduino, etc.,have helped me enhance my passion towards learning about technology. I have completed various online courses from coursera, udemy, etc, on Machine Learning, Web development, Neural Networking, Cyber security, etc. 
I always find tranquility while I’m working on any development based programming . I throughly relish the world of technology and I hope I can contribute something to it by equipping myself with all the needed skills to have a full-fledged career in Computer Science as an analyst or program developer and deliver hands-on projects. I feel that with its concise facilities and qualified faculty doing quality research work in the field of Computer Science and Technology ,will be the consummate place for me to pursue graduate studies. The working atmosphere of a strenuously agile department will be helpful in motivating me towards brilliance.
